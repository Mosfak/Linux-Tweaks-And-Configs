Followed this guide [Install Ubuntu on WSL2 and get started with graphical applications](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview) 

default gui app does not have minimize and maximize button. 

> gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ":minimize,maximize,close"

here, the colon : on left represents the buttons should be on right. to move them to left move the colon to the right.
